The Raghavan Family is a well known benefactor in the Atlanta community and has
given many generous charitable donations throughout the city to both Indian and non-
Indian organizations. We are very fortunate that they sponsor a 4 year scholarship to the
IASF and have now donated over $54,000 to the IASF.
