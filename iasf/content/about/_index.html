    <h2 class="">Who are we?</h1>
    <p class="">
        IASF was started in 1993 by Dr. P. Ravi Sharma under the direction of the India American Cultural Association (IACA), a 501(c)(3) registered, non-profit, tax-exempt organization in the state of Georgia, USA. The goal of the Scholarship Fund was to provide financial assistance to high school students entering college. The scholarships are for Indian-American students, who are graduates of a school in Georgia.</p>
