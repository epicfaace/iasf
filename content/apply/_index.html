<h3>Scholarship Eligibility</h3>
The majority of the scholarships are based on financial need and merit combined.  However, there are a few scholarships based solely on merit such as the written essay and the highest SAT/ACT scores.  All academic scores and extra-curricular activities, including sports, will be used to evaluate the eligibility.<br><br>

All applicants must attend an accredited four-year college or university for undergraduate studies.  Furthermore, they must be of Asian-Indian descent and graduate from an accredited high school in Georgia.
